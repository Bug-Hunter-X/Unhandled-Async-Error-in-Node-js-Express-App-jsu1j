This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming: unhandled errors within callbacks. The `bug.js` file contains code that simulates an asynchronous operation that might throw an error. The error is not properly handled, and will cause the server to crash, or lead to an unhandled promise rejection in a more complex application. The `bugSolution.js` shows a corrected version using proper error handling techniques.
